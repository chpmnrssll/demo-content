# Counterparty Management

#### View list of authorized counterparties

Users can view the list of counterparties with whom they are able to interact on the komgo platform by clicking _**Counterparty Management**_ on the platform menu on the left hand side of the screen.

Users can then transitioned to view a list of counterparties which are in their coverage group and manage them accordingly.

#### Add a new counterparty

A new counterparty can be added to a user's list of authorised parties to interact with on the komgo platform.

Users can extend their coverage group by adding new counterparties. This is done on the Counterparty Management page.

Click _**Add New**_ to add a new counterparty, and select any company from the list of companies already onboarded on the komgo platform. Submit a request to add the company to your counterparty coverage group.

#### Review counterparty request

Users on the komgo platform with the appropriate permissions receive counterparty request notification.

Users can approve or refuse incoming coverage requests. Click the request to select the appropriate option.

#### Add corporate counterparties for received trade \(auto\)

A company on the komgo platform can receive trades from the VAKT trading platform with a counterparty that they are yet to interact with on the komgo platform. When this happens, the counterparty is automatically added to the coverage list of the entity they have yet to interact with.

This ensures a seamless user experience from the operator on VAKT to the trade finance manager on komgo.
