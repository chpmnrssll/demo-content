# LC Acknowledge

After Issuance of a direct LC the Beneficiary receives access to the read-only LC uploaded by the Issuing Bank. Alternatively, for a non-direct-LC the beneficiary receives access to the read-only LC uploaded by the Issuing Bank after the Advising Bank has accepted the LC.

To complete the action, the user at the Beneficiary must click _**Accept LC**_. After this is done, a notification of the acceptance is sent to all participants, LC status is updated to _**LC Acknowledged**_.
