The Relationship Manager acts as the facilitator in a trade finance transaction on behalf of the corporate Applicant or Beneficiary, depending on the Banks role in a given commodity trade. If the Bank is acting as the Issuing Bank, the Relationship Manager has the user permission ‘manage LC Request’. This enables them to review the request for financing and accept the issuance of a requested Letter of Credit by the Applicant. In the role of the Advising Bank, the Relationship Manager has the user permission to review the received Issued LC and the ability to accept it, therefore advising it to the Beneficiary. The Relationship Manager is also responsible for the management of counterparties.
