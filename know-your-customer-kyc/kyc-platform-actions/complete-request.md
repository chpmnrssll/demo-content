# Responding to a Document Request

#### Complete Request

When responding to a document request, users receive a notification of a document request from a counterparty which they must be able to fulfil.

The responding users can access the request in two ways:

* Via a _**notification**_ which contains an action button
* Via their _**task list**_

Any document types registered in the responding user&#39;s library are _**automatched**_ to the given request and are proposed for selection.

Responding users can _**select**_ or _**deselect**_ a checkbox to add/remove a document from the request, for example, if the wrong passport has been automatched.

#### Register Document

If a document has been requested which has not been automatched from the users document library, responding users can _**select**_ and _**deselect**_ documents to the proposed reply.

When a responding user chooses to register a document, the user clicks the _**Add Document**_ where a new screen is displayed where the user can upload the document. As part of this process, the responding user can _**name**_ the document and _**add predefined metadata**_ and an expiry date for the document if requested.

#### Send Response

After all documents for each item requested have been added, the responding user clicks _**Send documents**_ to send the documents to the requesting party.
